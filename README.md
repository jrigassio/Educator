A project for the amazon echo. 
Tiny Teacher Vocabulary contains a few SAT vocabulary words for review that will be randomly picked by the echo for each learning quiz. This list can easily be expanded upon in its directory's question.js.
Tiny Teacher Math works nearly identically, but instead generates 100 random times table questions for each learning quiz. The way that these JSON problems are generated is detailed in its directory's question.js.
